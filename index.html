            Hi! Welcome to my UofG Work Term Report website. This site will be where all of my work term reports for my co-op terms will be stored. 
            The work term reports for each job should give you a good understanding of what my role was at the companies I worked for and some of the cool projects I got to be apart of. Enjoy!
