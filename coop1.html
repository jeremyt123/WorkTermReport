        <h2>Work Term 1 - Blueprint Agencies - Web Developer</h2>

        </p><br>
        <h4>My Goals</h4>
        <p>
            Since my co-op was 8 months I had to create 2 sets of goals.<br><br>
            The goals for my first 4 months were
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Get better with SQL
                </li>
                <li>
                    Learn more about how the business runs
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get faster at diagnosing and solving website issues
                </li>
            </ol>
            The goals for my second 4 months were
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Continue getting better at SQL (Learning more advanced queries)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Get better at explaning technical information to clients
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue getting faster at diagnosing and solving website issues
                </li>
            </ol>

            <br>
            Overall I was able to accomplish these goals I had set.
            Going into the job I had very little exposure to SQL but coming out of it I feel confident in my abilities to write somewhat complex queries that work on large amounts of data efficiently. 
            My general understanding of how software projects run and are layed out really helped me increase my speed of diagnosing and solving problems. I also learned quite a bit about how a digital agency runs and was able to use what I learned to gain some clients after my work term ended.

        <h4>Job Description</h4>
        <p>
            Each day working at Blueprint brings new challenges and technologies but its always a great learning experience <br><br>
            Since I work on so many different projects day to day I will go over my 3 favorite projects in detail and just list the rest.

        <h5><a href="http://www.modernsales.ca" target="_blank">Modern Sales Co-op</a></h5>
        <p>
            Modern Sales Co-op is a company that connects store owners to product vendors all across Canada.
            Although looking very simple on the front-end, Modern Sales has an extremely large member/staff portal that is responsible for a large amount of their business operation
            <br><br>
            Due to the site becoming outdated I was tasked with rebuilding the site and all functionality with assistance from our senior developer<br><br>
            SOME parts of the member portal include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Extranet</strong><br>
                    Extranet is where most of their users will be. Extranet is a one-stop-shop for members to get any information they need about vendors.
                    Extranet has a Forum where users can post and ask questions, 
                    A News section where Admins can post product/shipment updates that specific users can see depending on role, 
                    Vendor Black Book, New Product Releases, and many other features.
                    Extranet receives a lot of traffic and usually sees around 500-700k visits per year.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>EATS - Estimated Arrival Time System</strong><br>
                    The EATS system is responsible for keeping track of all shipment times and provides accurate shipping time estimates based off location, product, and quantity.
                    The development of EATS required massive SQL tables and huge queries to link all the incoming data together.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Admin Dashboard</strong><br>
                    Although only used by a small subset of users the admin panel has a ton of functionality. 
                    In the admin panel you can find a User Role management system, Control over all vendors and members, Event planning, management, 
                    inviting, and ticket sales, and site traffic statistics to name a few.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Technologies used: PHP, mySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Concrete5, cPanel, phpMyAdmin, and Various PHP Libraries
        </p>
        <h5><a href="https://www.afuturethatfits.ca" target="_blank">A Future That Fits - Halton District School Board (HDSB) (no longer live)</a></h5>
        <p>
            Due to the pandemic, HDSB was not able to hold their annual Specialist High Skills Major (SHSM) Information event in person.
            A Future That Fits was the replacement for that event.
            <br><br>
            On the day of the event students could enter the site, choose a program that they were interested in, 
            see what schools offered that program, and join a google meet with the schools program supervisor to get information and ask questions about the program.
            <br><br>
            The challenge with this site was being able to handle the traffic on the day of the event as we were expecting 4000 students to join at around the same time causing a huge load on our server. 
            <br><br>
            This site was completely my project and I built every part of it.
            Using CloudFlare, AWS, and Loader.io I was able to setup the site so that on the day of we were able to handle 5000 unique visitors (turns out parents were also interested in attending).
            <br><br>
            Technologies used: CloudFlare, AWS, Loader.io, PHP, HTML, LESS, JavaScript, jQuery, Concrete5, Adobe XD, cPanel, Google Analytics

        <h5><a href="https://tradeshow.picocanada.com/" target="_blank">Pico Tradeshow</a></h5>
        <p>
            The Pico Tradeshow site was another example of a company continuing their previously in-person business during a pandemic.
            <br><br>
            Pico sells alot of products and in order to tell their customers about them they have in-person tradeshows throughout the year.
            <br><br>
            This site was their way to continue to have these tradeshows virutually. During a tradeshow customers can join this site and join one of the 4 possible Zoom calls displayed on the home page. 
            <br><br>
            Customers can watch the zoom calls to see the new products Pico have to offer. If a customer doesn't feel like watching the zoom call they can also view the catalogue or the featured tradeshow products.
            <br><br>
            Customers can even order the tradeshow products straight off the site at any point during the tradeshow.
            <br><br>
            My contribution to this site was developing the shopping cart functionality, assisting in developing the wordpress plugin for Pico to setup these tradeshows, 
            developing the featured products section, and a few other bits and pieces
            <br><br>
            Technologies used: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Wordpress, Adobe XD, cPanel, phpMyAdmin

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            In conclusion working for Blueprint was an great experience that taught me so much about web development and what goes into making and maintaining a website.<br><br>
            Because of what I learned at Blueprint I was able to continue to freelance develop websites after my work term was over.
        </p><br>
        <h4>Acknowledgements</h4>
        <p>
            I'd like to thank Dan Read (senior developer) for teaching me so much about web development.
            I'd also like to thank Kyle Belbeck for teaching me the ins and outs of search engine optimization and for giving me better ways to interact with clients. 
            And of course I'd like to thank Aad Veymerden for hiring me and giving me this great opportunity.
